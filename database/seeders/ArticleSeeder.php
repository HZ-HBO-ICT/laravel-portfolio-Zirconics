                           Weaknesses: Too focused (too focused on 1 task, sometimes causing me to overlook other (smaller) tasks),
                           Too flexible towards uncooperative group members.
                           Opportunities: Learning lots in the field of ICT.
                           Threats: demotivated by group members (If I am grouped with unmotivated students I tend to be less motivated).'

                           Besides visiting I also made several online study choice tests and tried to do some programming myself.
                           This made me chose HBO-ICT because I have always been interested in how computers and the programs on them work.
                           That is because I like to find out how the different components work together and to play around with them.
                           Then I like to see what can be made with it all. I have also tried to make small games with the help of YouTube tutorials.'

                           do or was that more hobby and see if you could pull it off?
                           I see that you did a year of HBO information at Avans. Was
                           that through the AD or a full-time HBO course?
                           and what makes you make a switch to us? You indicate that you
                           can be too lenient towards group members who are less motivated for their studies.
                           I then read, you let the situation take its course and are less likely to
                           take action to stand up for yourself, is that right?
                           You never know what kind of group you will end up in but what are actions
                           that can be done in the team so that all noses and expectations match?
                           What could you do yourself to ensure that it does not affect your study
                           results and motivation? After I read the feedback, I found that some
                           points came across differently than I had initially intended.
                           This is because I mentioned some points but did not elaborate on them,
                           which led to miss-communication.
                           In spite of this, there were some remarks that I could use.'

                           For many of these projects, we were taught how to work with Git.
